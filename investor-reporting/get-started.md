# Get Started

**Step 1 : Upload reverse feed** Before accessing the transactions, reverse feeds obtained from the RTAs must be uploaded to populate transactions via Files API. The reporting engine supports the following different reverse feeds.

* Karvy: MFSD 201 without split
* CAMS: WBR2
* Franklin: MTFP (my transactions for period)
* Sundaram: ER02

Please note down the file id of the uploaded file.

**Step 2 : Create a file operation**\
Use FileOperation API Create a `transaction_processing` file operation with file id of the reverse feed.

**Step 3 : Check the status of the file operation**\
Use the FileOperation API check the status and ensure that transaction processing is successful.

**Step 4 : Get the list of transactions**\
Use transactions API to get the list of transactions associated with a folio.

### How do I get the data points? <a href="#how-do-i-get-the-data-points" id="how-do-i-get-the-data-points"></a>

Note 1: This section explains ways to get different data points. All the data points mentioned in this section are obtained/generated from the transactions response from the transactions API. Please make yourself familiar with the object structure of the transactions as these fields are used extensively to generate the required data points.

Note 2: Transaction object has `isin` field to indicate the scheme associated with the transaction. However, calculation of some data points requires more scheme related info. In such cases, the idea is to use the `isin` associated with transaction to fetch the scheme details using Fund schemes API to facilitate calculation of data points.

Note 3 : When a transaction results in the decrease in number of units because of an action initiated by the investor, we need to figure out the units that need to be considered for decreasing. To aid this process, we use FIFO logic. For example, if an investor purchases 100 units on **1st Jan 2019** and another 100 units on **2nd Jan 2019** and redeems 150 units on **3rd Jan 2019**, then we have to decrease 150 units from the 200 purchased units. Using FIFO logic, we reduce 100 units purchased on **1st Jan 2019** and 50 units purchased on **2nd Jan 2019**. So we can say that the redemption of 150 units were **"sourced"** from transactions that happened on **1st Jan 2019** and **2nd Jan 2019** respectively. In such cases, the `sources` attribute contain information about transactions from which this particular transaction in question is **sourced** from.

Note 4 : Each purchase source in `sources` will contain `days_held` and `gain` attribute. Use the value of `days_held` field to get the holding period in days and to determine whether a particular `gain` is a short term gain or a long term gain.

| Type of mutual fund | Holding period | Gain type       |
| ------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Equity mutual funds | < 12 months    | Short term gain |
| Equity mutual funds | > 12 months    | Long term gain  |
| Debt mutual funds   | < 36 months    | Short term gain |
| Debt mutual funds   | > 36 months    | Long term gain  |

#### Data points which do not require explicit calculation. <a href="#data-points-which-do-not-require-explicit-calculation." id="data-points-which-do-not-require-explicit-calculation."></a>

| Data point       | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Redemption date  | See `traded_on` field of transactions with type = `redemption`                      |
| Redemption units | See `units` field of transactions with type = `redemption`                          |
| Purchase date    | See `purchased_on` field in the list of `sources` for the "sell" type transactions. |
| Sale price       | See `amount` field of transactions with type = `redemption`                         |

#### Data points which must be calculated. <a href="#data-points-which-must-be-calculated." id="data-points-which-must-be-calculated."></a>

To understand how other data points can be calculated, consider the following example.

| Transaction Id | `traded_on` | `type`       | `units` | `traded_at` | `amount` | `sources` |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| T1             | 01/02/2019  | `purchase`   | 100     | 10          | 1000     |           |
| T2             | 02/02/2019  | `purchase`   | 100     | 12          | 1200     |           |
| T3             | 03/02/2019  | `redemption` | 150     | 15          | 2250     | \[T1, T2] |

The following table describes the way to calculate each one of the data points.
