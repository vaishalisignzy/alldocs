# Investor Reporting



**Why should I use Reporting APIs?**

Reporting API platform is a unified API platform which provides a single interface to access different reports from different RTAs. The platform manages all the report specific and RTA specific idiosyncrasies under the hood so that the API consumers can focus on what matters the most : Reports and data points.

**What kinds of reports can I get?**

| Transactions    | A list of transactions per folio per scheme(isin). Most of the data points including holdings related data points can be generated from a list of the trasactions.

**What are the different cases supported by the reporting engine?**

The reporting engine incorporates rules for handling the below cases -

* Scheme mergers: The impact of mutual fund scheme categorizations has been built into reports like holdings and capital gains.
* Folio consolidation: If the user decides to merge transactions of all folios into a single folio for a particular scheme.
* Transfer in/Transfer out: If the user changes his/her broker.
* Migration of exsiting folios: Upload of investor data and transaction data; reconcilliation and then generation of data points to ensure updated data is available.
