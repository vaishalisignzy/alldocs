## Data and Documents

**Understanding APIs :** An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions, procedures, methods or classes used by computer programs to request services from the operating system, software libraries or any other service providers running on the computer. A computer programmer uses the API to make application programs. You can read more about APIs [here](https://kids.kiddle.co/Application\_programming\_interface).

We have listed all APIs in the backops section here. There are 46 APIs in total. Whenever you click on any of these APIs, you can see that four things are consistent: Label, Variable, Text Match, and Verification.&#x20;

Additionally, all APIs shown here are marked as safe to use, which means that the security of the users is not compromised.

## **Due Diligence**

Here the due diligence checks are shown with labels and variables. AML, Geo-Tagging and Browser data checks perform the database verification.

1. Once the application is submitted
2. For Negative due diligence, database verification will be performed for  AML, CFT, Lending and Non compliance checks
3. All the submitted details will be verified and match scores will be generated by the decision engine

Integrating Negative DD (AML/CFT) in GO. Not just an API addition but a value added functionality that helps in decision making.

## **Forensics**

The document uploaded will be forged if :&#x20;

* If ID is wrong&#x20;
* If it is not colour image&#x20;
* If mentioned text is not present in image

The Document Cross Verification will help you detect one if there.
