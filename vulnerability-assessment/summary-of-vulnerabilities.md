# Summary of Vulnerabilities

### 1. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&#x20;

The Access-Control-Allow-Origin was set to ‘origin’, hence this allowed an arbitrary user to intercept the request and add an extra ‘Origin’ header with a value of any random website like ‘https://bing.com’

### 2. External HTTP Interaction

As there was no URL check when calling for images from persist signzy's domain, hence it was possible to add external URL to call for the file, hence it was possible to connect to any domain other than persist signzy's domain

### 3. Server Side Request Forgery - SSRF

As it is possible to call for domains other than signzy.tech, hence by inserting anything like, localhost or 127.0.0.1, which resulted in SSRF, which was confirmed when we tried to connect to 127.0.0.1/localhost on port numbers 22,80,443,5901 etc. It resulted in 500 error with information which was confirming port scanning.

### 4. Command Injection

Few network commands were injected in a parameter, which resulted in running the commands, hence verifying the case of Command Injection in this case. The commands used were "ping", "nslooukp" etc.

### 5. Possible SQL injection

There were APIs which were responding strangely when injected with single quotes, resulted in confirming the case of SQL injection.

### 6. Malicious File Upload to XSS / HTML Injection / Open Redirect

The mime type of the file being uploaded on the server was not being cross checked whether the file is indeed an image or not, because of which the custom domain of the file uploaded, is vulnerable to XSS/ HTML Injection / Open Redirect.
