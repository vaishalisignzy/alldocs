# Recommendation

These are the vulnerabilities detected by Automated tool.&#x20;

Below are the Description and Remidation for the same.

### 1. CSRF

#### Description:

CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on the victim's behalf. For most sites, browser requests automatically include any credentials associated with the site, such as the user's session cookie, IP address, Windows domain credentials, and so forth. Therefore, if the user is currently authenticated to the site, the site will have no way to distinguish between the forged request sent by the victim and a legitimate request sent by the victim.

#### Remidation:

The most common method to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks is to append CSRF tokens to each request and associate them with the userâ€™s session. Such tokens should at a minimum be unique per user session, but can also be unique per request. By including a challenge token with each request, the developer can ensure that the request is valid and not coming from a source other than the user.

### 2. Missing Rate Limit

#### Description:

An attacker can always discover a password through a brute-force attack, but the downside is that it could take years to find it. Depending on the password's length and complexity, there could be trillions of possible combinations. To speed things up a bit, a brute-force attack could start with dictionary words or slightly modified dictionary words because most people will use those rather than a completely random password. These attacks are called dictionary attacks or hybrid brute-force attacks. Brute-force attacks put user accounts at risk and flood your site with unnecessary traffic.

#### Remidation:

The most obvious way to block brute-force attacCross Site Scriptingks is to simply lock out accounts after a defined number of incorrect password attempts. Account lockouts can last a specific duration, such as one hour, or the accounts could remain locked until manually unlocked by an administrator. However, account lockout is not always the best solution, because someone could easily abuse the security measure and lock out hundreds of user accounts

### 3. CSP Header Missing

#### Description:

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a computer security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context.

#### Remidation:

Implement proper CSP header.

### 4. Strict-Transport-Security Header Missing

#### Description:

The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed.

#### Remidation:

Implement X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

### 5. Cross Site Scripting

#### Description:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

### 6. X-XSS-Protection Header Missing

#### Description:

The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

#### Remidation:

Implement X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block.

### 7. X-Frame-Options Header Missing

#### Description:

The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a \<frame>, \<iframe> or \<object>

#### Remidation:

Set X-Frame-Options header to deny, sameorigin or allow-from

### 8. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

#### Description:

The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed.

#### Remidation:

Implement X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
