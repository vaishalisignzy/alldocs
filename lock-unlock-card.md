# Lock/Unlock Card

Initiate a soft unlock or hard unlock of your customerâ€™s card, and if need be, the block card option can be activated. Soft lock requires no action as it can be done or undone by the card owner. A hard lock (Block) option can be enabled when the card is lost or damaged and a new card must be issued.
