# Basic information about service



**Deep-face-auth is a 3 step process**

1. **Create a user:** Create a user with basic details to generate an enrollment URL.
2. **Enroll user's face**: Upon creation of a user, an enrollment URL will be generated for that particular user. You are requested to share this enrollment portal URL with your user. Via that URL, they should enroll their face into the system. The URL portal should be opened only through supported browsers (refer to the supported browser in the next section).&#x20;
3. **Perform authentication or search actions**: Once enrolled, you can verify the user's face against a username through an authentication portal or search the user from a database from a set of faces without a username\
   \
   Note1 - You can choose to use Signzies enrollment, auth, and search frontend URL or choose to create your own frontend to capture the face.\
   \
   Note2 - The "User" is the user of your product or service.

**Follow these steps to achieve maximum performance**

* Please ensure proper lighting conditions when recording.&#x20;
* Please make sure the face does not move much during recording.
* Avoid multiple faces in front of the camera.
