# Envrionments

For ease of development, Wayne RTA provides two kinds of environments:

1. Test Environment
2. Live Environment

The dashboard displays the "LIVE/TEST" toggle to switch between both environments. TEST and LIVE environments are identical except that no real investor creation and transactions are made in the TEST environment. TEST environment speeds up your product experimentation and development.
