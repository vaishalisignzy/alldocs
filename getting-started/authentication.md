# Authentication

All requests must be made over HTTPS and authenticated over standard HTTP basic authentication. You need to pass the TEST or LIVE API key in the header. You can view and manage your API keys in the Wayne Dashboard. API keys must be kept secret. They should not be in your client-side code or checked into your application's code.
