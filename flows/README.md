# ðŸª£ FLOWS

Flows could simply be viewed as a bucket containing multiple pages that are used during an onboarding process, or it is a collection of multiple pages that the onboarding user will be going through his onboarding journey.

The flow created, will appear under My Flows at the bottom. Later on, we can even add or remove pages in the flow by simply clicking on the Edit button and then checking or unchecking the pages to be added or removed, as shown in the above GIF above.
