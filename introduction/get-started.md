# Get Started

#### Authentication

Once you sign up, you will receive a set of API keys via email to authenticate requests. Each API key is valid only for a specific time frame. In case you lose them or need a fresh set of keys, just head over to your dashboard and generate one. These keys are only for initial testing (using cleartext) in our Sandbox. Once you complete the initial testing, then you need to upgrade to our Pre-Prod environment.

**Pre-Prod Environment**

Our Pre-Prod environment uses a mix of keys/certificates based on mutual authentication. At this stage, we require a bit more information about your server's IPs, certificates, and so on**.** You also need to specify a set of attributes that you want to integrate with the product. Once we assimilate the necessary information, our support team will deploy a custom Pre-Prod environment suited to your requirements

#### Production Environment

Once the product reaches the production stage, all API calls will be authenticated using the Keys/Certificates based on mutual authentication. Here again, you might need to provide a similar set of information to obtain the authentication parameters. Along with this set-up, we will also provide the required Authentication parameters and Security framework. You might need to develop these two factors to suit your production environment
