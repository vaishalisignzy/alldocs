# Identity

Mutual Funds in India are regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India)&#x20;

As per SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), all financial intermediaries have to establish the identity of the investoer before accepting any investments. This process is commonly known as KYC (Know Your Customer).

First step is to check whether the investor is KYC compliant. If not, a KYC process has to be performed.&#x20;
