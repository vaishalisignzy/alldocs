# Identity

Establishing the identity of an investor is the key requirement to comply with the AML (Anti money laundering) and KYC (Know your customer) norms, some provided as guidelines and some as regulations.

Mutuals funds in India are regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) and it mandates all the financial intermediaries to follow certain guidelines in establishing and verifying the identity of an investor before accepting any investments from them, which is commonly called as KYC (Know your customer).

With FP you can check the KYC status of your investor and if he is not compliant, perform a KYC.
