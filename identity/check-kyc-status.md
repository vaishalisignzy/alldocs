# Check KYC Status

#### Check kyc status <a href="#check-kyc-status" id="check-kyc-status"></a>

Call the KYC Check with the investor's Income Tax Permanent Account Number (PAN)

```
{

    "pan": "ARRPP1115N",
    "date_of_birth": "1955-10-25"

}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
_`date_of_birth` is needed only to fetch the KYC data. This is an additional request body parameter along with the PAN number in-order to fetch the data from KRA databases. If you are using this API to check the KYC status alone, then the request body should only contain the PAN number._
{% endhint %}

**Status**

If the `status` in the response object is `true`, it means the investor details exists in one of the KRA's databases and his KYC is under process or completed successfully. You can go ahead and onboard the investor and place purchase and redemption orders.

If the `status` is `false`, it means the investor either does not exist in any of the KRA's databases or his KYC is unsuccessful. We recommend that you do not accept any orders from the investor at this stage, as they will get rejected during the processing at the RTA.

**Investor Details**

The `entity_details` in the response object will contain the investor's demographic information. If you are checking for the KYC status, you'll get the `name` of the investor. If you are fetching the KYC details of an investor, then the `entity_details` list in the response object will contain Identity, Address and Contact information of the investor as shown below:

```
# Displaying only a part of the object for brevity

"entity_details": {
        "name": "Tony Soprano",
        "gender": "male",
        "date_of_birth": "1955-10-25",
        "father_name": "James Soprano",
        "marital_status": "married",

        "email": "tony.soprano@gmail.com",
        "mobile": "9123498765"
}

> **NOTE**: To fetch an investor's demographic information from the KRA databases, you need to be a SEBI registered entity with RIA, AMC or other licences. Currently, AMFI regulated ARN holders cannot avail this feature.
