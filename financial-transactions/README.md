# Financial Transactions

You can buy, sell, or transfer a Mutual Fund. You need to [create an investor](../investor/create-an-investor.md) and [create a folio](../investor/create-a-folio.md) before placing any buy or sell orders. You can place a lumpsum order for buy or sell. You can also do a systematic order placement for buy or sell.
