| Payment was not completed on time                           | Payment Gateway | This usually happens when payment couldn't get completed within a stipulated time set by the banks and the session expires and we don't receive a callback from the bank. This may happen due to various reasons, for instance, the user does not receive an OTP or there is network fluctuation at the user's end. |
| Payment failed                                              | Payment Gateway | Payment is declined by the bank gateway where the exact reason is not disclosed by the bank. Banks usually decline the payments when the transaction is not verified, suspecting a certain risk factor (fraudulent transaction) or the customerâ€™s transaction deviates from his current purchasing pattern.         |
