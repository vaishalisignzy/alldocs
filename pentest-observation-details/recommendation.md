## Recommendation&#x20;

### 1. Click Jacking&#x20;

The `frame-ancestors` directive can be used in a Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a `<frame>` or `<iframe>`. Sites can use this to avoid Clickjacking attacks by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.

`frame-ancestors` allows a site to authorise multiple domains using the normal Content Security Policy semantics.

### 2. Cross Origin Resource Sharing&#x20;

Use of `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` should  be used only for the white listed domains. Also by adding a referer header authentication for Origin header.

### 3. External HTTP Interaction

Interaction with external HTTP should only be filtered out and possibly used with white listed domains in the domain. Also the intended behaviour of the API&#x20;

### 4. Server Side Request Forgery&#x20;

Again filtering out HTTP interaction, and blacklisting the following,

* localhost
* 127.0.0.1
* http://0177.1/
* http://0x7f1.1/
* http://127.000.000.1
* https://520968996
* http://\[::1]&#x20;
* http://\[::]

### 5. Command Injection&#x20;

Blacklisting special characters like :

* |
* &
* ;
* \`

### 6. Possible SQL Injection

Blacklisting special characters like :

* \>
* <
* '
* "
* \#
* /\* , \*/
* \-
* \`
* \~

### 7. Malicious File Upload to XSS / HTML Injection / Open Redirect

Keeping a Content-Type filter to upload any data and for confirming the same for any image file. Also checking the meta data for the same.\




### 8. User Data Leakage

By changing the method from POST to GET, all user data were being leaked in advanced extraction APIs.
