# Clickjacking

### **Vulnerable API:**

All

### Severity:

Low

### **Description:**

While Testing the API using postman and BURP Suite,  X-Frame-Options were not set for any domain, which made it vulnerable to clickjacking. Hence to verify this issue, HTML document was created which was verifying the clickjacking attack using iframe attribute.

### **Steps:**

1. Open the URL using a browser, check for the X-FRAME-OPTIONS on the response HEADERS.
2. As you can see you can not find X-FRAME-OPTIONS anywhere, load the below html file and run it.
3. Once you open the file you will be redirected to preproduction.signzy.tech login page.

```markup
<html>
<body>
<iframe src = "https://preproduction.signzy.tech/" height=500px width=2000px></iframe>
<p>Frame Running?</p>
<p>ClickJacking</p>
</html>
```

&#x20;    4\. You can find the working Proof Of Concept for the same.

5\. The above confirms that the API headers have not been set to X-FRAME-OPTIONS = 1.

### **Impact:**

The above vulnerability can be used as a method for Phishing attacks.

### Solution:

The `frame-ancestors` directive can be used in a Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a `<frame>` or `<iframe>`. Sites can use this to avoid Clickjacking attacks by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.

`frame-ancestors` allows a site to authorise multiple domains using the normal Content Security Policy semantics.\
