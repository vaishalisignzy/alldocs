# ⚛ THEMES

A theme creator allows us to choose from predefined themes or to create a fully customized theme based on our requirements. We can create themes for both merchant and Back ops portals.

### **Signzy’s default theme for the Merchant portal**

Signzy provides a predefined theme for the Merchant portal, which can be tweaked and edited, however, only limited actions can be performed.

### **Creating a new theme for the Merchant portal**

When we select to create a new theme, we get a total blank theme page which could be customized from scratch as per the requirements, all the settings and options remain the same as discussed in Signzy’s default theme above.

**It is very simple and easy to setup the theme page**

## **Customize instruction and Thank you pages**

We can also configure pages under a flow and provide the following instructions:&#x20;

* Do you want to add an Instruction Page?&#x20;
* Do you want to add Thank you, Page?&#x20;
* Do you want to add a journey termination page?

If in any of the following we wish to configure, then we need to check Yes then go to View Template and configure it as per the instruction.
