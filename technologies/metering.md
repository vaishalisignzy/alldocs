# Metering

Signzy software pods come preinstalled with metering solutions, which are designed to work remotely sharing telemetry data to common sources either&#x20;

1. Through a self triggerred mechanism (generally used where connectivity to Signzy metering system is available)
2. Human triggerred process (generally used where connectivity cannot be established due to security or business reasons)

The data collected in metering system includes name of product that was used, usage counts and certain time series data. The data is further used to compile the invoicing and billing information.

The meter files are ensured to be tamper & loss proof.
