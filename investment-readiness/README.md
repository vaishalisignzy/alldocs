# Investment Readiness

As per [SEBI](https://www.sebi.gov.in/) mandates, in addition to KYC details, you also need to collect and verify the following details of an Investor.&#x20;

* [Email ID](email-id.md)
* [Mobile Number](mobile-number.md)
* [FATCA & Other Declarations](fatca-and-other-declarations.md)
* [Signature](signature.md)
* [Nominee Registration](nominee-registration.md)
* [Bank Account Details](bank-account-details.md)

You can collect, verify and share the details of an Investor with us using our APIs. Once these details are verified, you can consider the Investor "Investment Ready". Post that, you will be able to let the Investor make payments and invest in different funds of your AMC.
