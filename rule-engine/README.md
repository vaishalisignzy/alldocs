# ðŸŽ¯ RULE ENGINE

In Generic Onboarding, the Rule Engine provides a way to add a direction to the Onboarding Flow. As a way of incorporating certain evaluation checks, it can also add customizable conditions and rules to the flow. A rule is generally composed of multiple conditions tied together by a logical operator.

### Create rules

1. Choose a Flow   :  Choose a Flow from the available list.
2. Select a screen :  Select a screen from the flow to add rules/conditions.
3. Add conditions  :  On selecting a particular screen, the first step in creating rules is to add  conditions.

#### **Generic onboarding currently provides 3 types of conditions:**

1. **No conditions                :** On selecting this, you only have to provide the destination screen.
2. **Logical conditions      :** On selecting this type, you must create a condition with the following fields: a) Variable  b) Operator  c) Values
3. **API based conditions:** On selecting this type, we must first select the API from the API list, then map all the API input variables to the corresponding page variables. Lastly, you must create a condition with the following fields: a) Variable  b) Operator  c) Values
4. **Add Rules**\
   Once the required conditions are created, you can create a rule by combining conditions with various logical operators. You also have to specify the destination on True / False.
