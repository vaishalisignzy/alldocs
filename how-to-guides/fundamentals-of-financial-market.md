## What is the Securities Market?

The securities markets provide a regulated institutional framework for an efficient flow of capital (equity and debt) from investors to businesses in the financial market system. It provides a channel for allocation of savings to investments. Thus, the savings of households, business firms and government can be channelized through the medium of securities market to fund the capital requirements of a business enterprise and government. Savings are linked to investments by a variety of intermediaries through a range of complex financial products called “securities”. Securities are financial instruments issued by companies, financial institutions or the government to raise funds. These securities are purchased by investors who in turn convert their savings into financial assets.

> The market in which securities are issued, purchased by investors, and subsequently transferred among investors is called the securities market.

### **What are the types of securities available in the Securities Market?**

A security represents the terms of exchange of money between two parties. Securities are issued by companies, financial institutions or the government and are purchased by investors who have the money to invest. The broader universe of savers with surplus to invest is available to the issuers of securities; a universe of wider options is available to savers to invest their money in.

Security issuance allows borrowers to raise money at a reasonable cost while security ownership allows investors to convert their savings into financial assets which provide a return. Thus, the objectives of the issuer and the investor are complementary, and the securities market provides a platform to mutually satisfy their goals.

**Securities can be broadly classified into equity and debt.** The terms of issue, rights of investors, risk and return for these two classes of securities varies widely. Return refers to the benefits that the investor will receive from investing in the security. Risk refers to the possibility that the expected returns may not materialise. For example, a company may seek capital from an investor by issuing a bond. A bond is a debt security, which means it represents a borrowing of the company. The security will be issued for a specific period, at the end of which the amount borrowed will be repaid to the investor. The return will be in the form of interest, paid periodically to the investor, at a rate and frequency specified in the security. The risk is that the company may fall into bad times and default on the payment of interest or return of the capital.&#x20;

### **What are Equity Securities?**

**Equity capital refers to the capital provided by owners of the business, who are willing to take the risk that the business may take time to generate profits.** They also accept that these profits may not be fixed or remain unchanged over time.

Equity capital is denominated in equity shares, with a face value. Face value in India is typically Re. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5 or Rs. 10 per share. Investors buy equity shares (also called stocks) issued by the company to become shareholders that jointly own the company.

Equity capital can be provided by two types of shareholders. The first are the inside- shareholders or promoters who start the company with their funds and entrepreneurial skills. Large institutional investors such as venture capitalists may subscribe to equity in early stages and become inside investors. The second set of owners are outside-shareholders, or members of the public, who invest in the company’s equity shares at a later stage in order to fund its subsequent expansions and operations.

### **What are Debt Securities?**

**Debt capital refers to the capital provided by the lenders who are keen to be compensated regularly in the form of a pre-specified fixed rate of interest. They also expect the money they have lent to be returned to them after an agreed period of time.**

Debt capital may be raised by issuing various types of debt instruments such as debentures, bonds, commercial papers, certificates of deposit or pass-through certificates. Each of these instruments is defined for its tenor (the time period to maturity) and the rate of interest it would pay. As a practice, the rate of interest on debt instruments is represented as percent per annum on the face value of a debt security.

### **What is the Primary Market?**

**The primary market, also called the new issue market, is where issuers raise capital by issuing securities to investors.**

Investors and issuers are the main building blocks of a securities market. Issuers supply securities and create a demand for capital; and investors buy the securities and thereby provide the supply of capital. Interaction between investors and borrowers is facilitated through financial intermediaries who are the third component of the market. The entire process of issuance, subscription and transaction in securities is subject to regulatory control and supervision.

There are several major players in the primary market. These include the merchant bankers, mutual funds, financial institutions, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), individual investors; the issuers include companies, bodies corporate; lawyers, bankers to the issue, brokers, and depository participants. The role of stock exchanges in the primary market is limited to the extent of listing of the securities.

### **What is the Secondary Market?**

**The secondary market, also called the stock/securities exchange, facilitates trade in already-issued securities, thereby enabling investors to exit from an investment.** The risk in a security investment is transferred from one investor (seller) to another (buyer) in the secondary markets.

The constituents of secondary market are stock exchanges, stock brokers (who are members of the stock exchanges), asset management companies (AMCs), financial institutions, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), investment companies, individual investors, depository participants and banks.
