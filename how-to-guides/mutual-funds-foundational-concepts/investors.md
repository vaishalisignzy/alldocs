# Investors

There are two broad categories of investors in a Mutual Fund:

1. Individual Investors
2. Institutional Investors

## Individual Investors

These investors invest for their personal benefit or benefit of their family. There are many types of individual investors. They are:

### Resident Indian Adult Individuals

Investors above 18 years of age, invest either singly or jointly (maximum 3 holders)

### Minors

An individual investor, who is under 18 years of age, can invest through their guardians.

### Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)

HUF is an Indian structure where the pool of money belonging to a family is managed by a designated member of the family, identified as â€˜kartaâ€™. Transactions on behalf of HUF are done by the karta, in his/her name. He/she indicates that he/she is acting on behalf of HUF, by writing the "HUF" alongside his/her name.

### Non Resident Indian (NRI) / Person of Indian Origin (PIO) Resident Abroad

Indian citizens, who are working abroad, and their family residing abroad, are typical NRIs. A PIO is an individual whose spouse, parent or grandparent is an Indian citizen or an NRI.

### Foreign Investors

Foreign nationals who meet KYC requirements may invest in equity and debt schemes floated by domestic mutual funds.

ðŸ’¡ Unless specifically mentioned as non-resident, all individual investors are assumed to be resident. A resident is an Indian citizen, who has stayed in India for at least 182 days in a financial year.

## Institutional Investors

The investments are made by organizations/institutions. Their authorized individuals sign the documents on behalf of the organizations/institutions they represent. The following are various types of institutional investors who invest in mutual funds in India:

### Private & Public Companies

These are companies set up under the Indian Companies Act.

### Partnership Firms

These are firms set up by individuals who are partners coming together under a partnership deed.

### Association Of Persons

These are associations set up by individuals to undertake a set of activities as defined by the terms of their charter.

### Societies & Trusts

These are organisations that pool individual contributions and manage them according to set objectives. Trusts and societies can be set up for social, religious, and educational purposes.

### Banks & Financial Institutions (FIs)

Banks are set up under the Banking Regulation Act. Financial institutions are either set up by an Act or as corporations.

### Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)

FIIs are foreign institutions that are permitted to invest in the Indian securities markets after having obtained registration as Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) from SEBI.

### Other Mutual Funds registered with SEBI

### International Multilateral Agencies approved by the Government of India

### Army/Navy/Air Force, Para-Military Units and other eligible institutions

### Scientific and Industrial Research Organizations

### Universities and Educational Institutions

ðŸ’¡ Individual investors invest in their own capacity. Institutional investors have to follow a process before they can invest in mutual funds. Institutions usually authorise specific individuals to execute the investment decision on their behalf.

## Investor Information

Individual investors investing in mutual funds are required to provide the following information when they invest in mutual funds:

### Name

Name of the investor is used to identify the person in whose name the investment has been made. In a mutual fund, the beneficiary is the person who is holding the folio.

### Signature

Signature is the identity of the investor in the records of the mutual fund. It is verified for every transaction. All valid transactions should carry the signature of the investor.

### Joint Holders

An application can have up to three joint holders. They may decide to operate their investments jointly or on either or survivor basis. All joint holder signatures are captured in the RTA system irrespective of the mode of operation.

### Correspondence Address

The address of the investor is to enable physical identification of the investorâ€™s location. In case of an NRI investor, overseas address is required. Address of the first holder is the address for correspondence in the investor records.

### KYC

In order to ensure that illegal funds are not routed into Indian markets, the government has promulgated the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to this Act, the identity of those entering into financial transactions must be known and verified. The procedure to do this is now known as KYC (Know Your Customer) norms.

KYC norms apply to opening bank accounts, trading accounts, demat accounts and all such financial relationships. Proof of identity of the customer, and proof of residence are verified to comply with KYC norms. SEBI has mandated a uniform KYC procedure for mutual funds, brokers, depository participants, portfolio managers and venture capital funds. The investors can undergo the KYC process with any of the above intermediaries and it will be applicable for their transactions with the other intermediaries too. The information for KYC is uploaded by the intermediary onto the system provided by a centralized agency called by the KYC Registration Agency (KRA). The KRA will maintain the information and make it available to the intermediaries.

KYC once completed, is valid across mutual funds and all the other SEBI registered intermediaries (i.e. across capital market). KYC related activities are handled by KYC Registration Agencies (KRA). SEBI has mandated that KRAs share data and information with other KRAs so that retail investors are not inconvenienced in the KYC documentation.

### FATCA Declaration

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a 2010 United States federal law to enforce the requirement for United States persons including those living outside the U.S. to file yearly reports on their non U.S. financial accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN). It requires all non U.S. (foreign) financial institutions (FFIs) to search their records for indicia indicating U.S. person status and to report the assets and identities of such persons to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

### **Nomination**

The applicant can make a nomination in favour of a maximum of three nominees and indicate the percentage to each nominee. The nomination can be made at the time of application or subsequently at any time. A folio held by a single holder should have a nomination made in the application. Some mutual funds may require the applicant to provide a separate declaration of the intention not to nominate. Others may have a provision that not providing the nomination details may be considered as consent to proceed with the application without a nomination.

### Bank Accounts

Mutual funds provide investors the facility to register multiple bank accounts to facilitate receiving the redemption, dividends and any other pay outs from the fund. An individual investor can register up to five bank accounts and a non-individual investor, ten. The first holder of the folio must be an account holder in each of the accounts that are registered. One of the accounts is designated as the default account, and unless otherwise specified all credits are made to this account by the mutual fund. Investors can change the default bank account at any time by instructing the AMC to do so.
