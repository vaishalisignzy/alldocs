# Structure & Constituents

Let us understand the structure of a Mutual Fund.

## A Brief Background

Mutual Fund can be structured in two ways.

1. As a Company - It can be structured as a company in which investors of the Mutual Fund would hold the shares of the company. Investors of the Mutual Fund would be the shareholders of the company.
2. As a Trust - It can be structured as a trust in which investors of the Mutual Fund would be the beneficiaries of the trust. Investors of the Mutual Fund would be the beneficial owners of the trust.

Mutual Fund first began in the USA. In USA, Mutual Fund are structured as a company. In UK, open-ended funds are created with the structure of a trust, while, close-ended funds are set up with a structure of a trust or a company.

In India, Mutual Fund are created as a trust. The investors of the Mutual Fund are the beneficial owners of the investments held by the trust.

[Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)](https://www.sebi.gov.in/), the regulator of securities markets in India, has laid down the structure of Mutual Fund to be followed in India in the regulation "[SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996](https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/regulations/dec-1996/sebi-mutual-funds-regulations-1996\_19376.html)".

## 3-Tier Structure

Mutual Fund in India are created as a trust and follow a three-tier structure of sponsor, trust and asset management company (AMC).

### Introduction

The Mutual Fund trust is created by one or more sponsors, who are the main persons behind the Mutual Fund business. It is managed by trustees in the beneficial interest of the unitholders. Every trust has beneficiaries. The beneficiaries, in the case of a Mutual Fund trust, are the investors who invest in various schemes of the Mutual Fund. The sponsors promotes the Mutual Fund and also sets up an asset management company (AMC) to run the Mutual Fund business.

üí° [SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996](s://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/regulations/dec-1996/sebi-mutual-funds-regulations-1996\_19376.html) as amended till date define ‚Äúmutual fund‚Äù as ‚Äúa fund established in the form of a trust to raise monies through the sale of units to the public or a section of the public under one or more schemes for investing in securities including money market instruments or gold or gold-related instruments or real estate assets.‚Äù

### Who is a Sponsor?

A sponsor is the promoter of a Mutual Fund, who sets up the trust and the AMC. Sponsors can be Indian companies, banks, financial institutions, or, foreign companies. For example, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has been set up by ICICI Bank and Prudential Plc, as a joint venture.

### Who are the Trustees?

As you already know by now that the Mutual Fund is set up as a trust. In simple words, trustees are the people who run and manage the trust. A trust deed is executed by the sponsor in favour of the trustees. The trust deed deals with the establishment of the trust, the authority and responsibility of the trustees towards the unitholders and the AMC.

The sponsor appoints the trustees with the approval of SEBI, to act on behalf of the investors. Trustees act as the protectors of the unitholders‚Äô interests and are the primary guardians of the unitholders‚Äô funds and assets.

Trustees can be appointed as a board of trustees, or formed as a trustee company by the sponsor. The board of such trustee company oversees the Mutual Fund. Trustees are paid a fee for their services. Trustees appoint an AMC to manage the funds on behalf of the investors.

### What does an AMC do?

Asset Management Company (AMC) is the investment manager of the Mutual Fund. They manage investor's money for a fee, usually determined as a percentage of the Assets Under Management (AUM). AMCs can be structured as public or private limited companies. The capital of the AMC is contributed by the sponsors.

AMCs are the face of the Mutual Fund. They set up offices, employ staff, create and market products, mobilise funds through distributors, manage the investor's money and report the portfolio performance to the trustees and the investors.

The rights and obligations of the AMC are specified in the Investment Management Agreement signed between the trustees and the AMC.

AMCs focus on managing the portfolio of the Mutual Fund. They outsource several operations and functions to other constituents. The core function is fund management, which cannot be outsourced. Portions of the operations functions such as investor records, fund accounting and valuation are outsourced. Core functions in these areas are done in-house, while other functions are outsourced to constituents. Some funds may choose to do some of these functions in-house.

Mutual Fund constituents (except custodians) are appointed by the AMC with the approval of the trustees. Custodians are appointed by the trustees.

## Custodian

Custodians hold the cash and securities of the Mutual Fund and are responsible for their safekeeping. They hold actual custody of the assets of the Mutual Fund. As such, the custodian accepts and gives delivery of securities for the purchase and sale transactions of the various schemes of the Mutual Fund. Thus, the custodian settles all the transactions on behalf of the Mutual Fund schemes.

Custodians are appointed by the trustees. A custodial agreement is entered into between the trustees and the custodian. They represent the only constituent not directly appointed by the AMC. Custodians should be independent of the sponsor. It means that a sponsor cannot be a custodian of the Mutual Fund as well. For example, ICICI Bank is a sponsor of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund. It is also a custodian bank. But it cannot offer its custody services to ICICI Prudential Mutual fund, because it is also the sponsor. An independent custodian ensures that the securities are indeed held in the scheme for the benefit of the investors, an important control aspect.

A few of the responsibilities of the custodian are:

* Delivering and accepting securities and cash, to complete transactions made in the investment portfolio of the Mutual Fund.
* Tracking and completing corporate actions and payouts such as rights issue, bonus issue, offer for sale, buy back offers, dividends, interest and redemptions on the securities held by the Mutual Fund.
* Coordinating with the depository participants (DPs) who hold the securities account of the Mutual Fund schemes.

Some custodians also offer fund accounting and valuation services to Mutual Funds.

## RTA

The Registrar and Transfer Agency (RTA) is primarily responsible for providing services to the investors. They accept and process investor's transactions. They maintain investor records as well as allots or redeems units, processes purchase/redemption/switch requests, dividends, etc. They also generates the account statement that an investor receives. RTAs are paid a fee for their services.

A few of the key responsibilities of RTA are:

* Issuing and redeeming units and updating the unit capital account
* Enabling investor transactions such as purchase, redemption and switches
* Creating, maintaining and updating investor records
* Banking the payment instruments (cheques and drafts) given by investors and notifying the AMC
* Processing payouts to investors in the form of dividends and redemptions
* Sending statutory and periodic information to investors

## Other Constituents

### Auditors

Auditors audit the books of the mutual fund. There are separate auditors for the AMC‚Äôs accounts.

### Brokers

Brokers execute the buy and sell transactions of the fund managers.

### **Fund Accountant**

The fund accountant performs the role of calculating the NAV, by collecting information about the assets and liabilities of each scheme. The AMC can either handle this activity in-house or engage a service provider. A few of the custodians also provide the service of fund accounting. There is no need for a registration with SEBI to perform this function. Fund accountant maintains the book of accounts of each individual mutual fund scheme and calculates NAV on a daily basis.

### **Collecting Bankers & Payment Aggregators**

The investors‚Äô money goes into the bank account of the scheme they have invested in. These bank accounts are maintained with collection bankers who are appointed by the AMC.

While banks play a big role in facilitating Mutual Fund transactions, a new category of players have made an entry, the payment aggregators. There are some payment gateway providers, digital wallets, and payment banks. All these players facilitate the transactions by allowing investors to buy Mutual Fund units.

### **KYC Registration Agencies (KRA)**

It is mandatory for all investors in the securities market, including the mutual fund investors, to be KYC (Know Your Customer) compliant under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The KYC process involves establishing the identity and the address of the investor. KRAs are primarily responsible for KYC process of the investors.

### **Depositories & Depository Participants**

A depository is an institution, which holds the securities in dematerialised or electronic form on behalf of the investors. Initially depositories held only equity shares on behalf of the investors, later other securities including mutual funds were also dematerialised. Investors have the option of holding their mutual fund units in dematerialised form through a depository participant. The depositories reach out to the investors through the depository participants.

### **Stock Exchanges & Transactions Platforms**

Investors can now transact in mutual fund units through the stock exchanges. The units of close- ended funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) are compulsorily listed on at least one stock exchange. At the same time, units of open-ended funds are also available through special segments on the stock exchanges. At the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), this segment is known as BSE StarMF; while at the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), it is called NSE Mutual Fund II Platform (NMF II). Now, investors can also transact directly through stock exchanges.

MF Utilities India is another transaction platform for units of mutual funds. Investors can perform various transactions such as purchase, sale, switch, etc. These platforms play a very important role in enhancing the reach of mutual funds.

### Distributors

AMCs appoint distributors who sell the mutual fund units to investors on behalf of the mutual fund. Distributors may work for more than one mutual fund. There is no exclusivity in mutual fund distribution. A distributor may also appoint sub-brokers for the purpose of distributing units.

Distributors may be individuals or institutions such as banks, Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) or broking and distribution companies.

All distributors must obtain an AMFI Registration Number (ARN) and stamp the same on all application forms sourced by them to ensure payment of commission. Further, AMFI will assign a unique identification number to employees, relationship managers, and other such sales personnel of the distributor who interact with the investors. This number is in addition to the ARN and should be mentioned in the application forms along with the ARN.

### AMFI

Mutual funds also have an industry association called the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). All AMCs are members of the AMFI. AMFI recommends and promotes best business practices and code of conduct to be followed by their members and others engaged in the activities of mutual fund and asset management including agencies connected or involved in the field of capital markets and financial services.
