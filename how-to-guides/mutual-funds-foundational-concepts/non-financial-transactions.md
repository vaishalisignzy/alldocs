# Non Financial Transactions

Investors may need to update or change the personal information given to the mutual fund. Address for communication, bank details, and change in status among others, may require change from time to time. These transactions are non-financial transactions. They do not have a financial or NAV implication.

The registrar and transfer agent captures the contact address, bank account details, status, plan or option chosen and all other relevant information. The RTA links the information given in the application to the folio allotted to the investor. In other words, folio number is a unique identification number that helps RTA agent recognise an investor.

## Change of Address (CoA)

Investors provide their address and contact details in the application form during the first purchase. RTA captures this information and maintains it. The statement of account (SoA) and other statutory communication goes to the address for communication mentioned by the investor.

Investors may request a change of address or contact details only by applying to the KRA by using a KYC update form, where they will provide their new address.

After updating the new address in the records, the KRA communicates the change in address to the RTA, who will update all the folios of the investor, across mutual funds, using the PAN as the identification for the investor. Change of address requests are no longer accepted at AMC offices or the investor service centres of RTA.

## Change of Bank Details (CoB)

It is mandatory to provide details of investor’s bank account at the time of investing in a mutual fund. As per SEBI regulations, dividend and redemptions are payable only to the investor’s bank accounts registered with RTA. Investors may register multiple bank accounts and indicate the default account into which the redemption proceeds should be paid. They can add and delete from the list of registered bank accounts. Investors may request a change in the bank details either at the time of a redemption or otherwise through the prescribed format for change in bank details.

Investors should provide the complete details of the bank account for the CoB request to be valid. This includes bank name, branch name, MICR (where applicable), IFSC code (where applicable) account number and type of account. The investor should also submit a cancelled blank cheque to enable verification of the bank details.

## Change in Option

Investors choose a dividend option or growth option when they apply for a scheme. Investors who have chosen the dividend option in a mutual fund investment select between dividend payout option - where the dividends are paid out to the investor by cheque and re- investment option - where additional units equivalent to the dividend amount is issued to the investor.

Investors may want to change from dividend payout to reinvestment option. To request this change, investors can use either the transaction slip (switch option provided in the slip) or write a letter to the mutual fund. Investors have to provide the folio details.

If the investor decides to change the dividend option, there is no financial implication. This is because the NAV for dividend payout and dividend reinvestment is the same. Therefore change of dividend payout option is a non-financial transaction and not a financial transaction.

## Change in Name (Individual Investors)

Investors may request a change of name under which they have invested in a mutual fund scheme. Common cases for change of name are women who like to change their maiden name to married name. In such cases, investors must submit a letter requesting the change.

Documents that should accompany the request letter are:

* Name change certificate by a regulatory authority
* Official Gazette copy
* Copy of Marriage Certificate
* New PAN Card with changed name
* Details of the Folio
* Signature of the account holder (the unit holder whose name is being changed must sign with the old signature and the new signature)
* Bank account details with the new name incorporated.
