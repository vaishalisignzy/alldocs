# Banking Operations In MF

## Bank Accounts

A mutual fund scheme has several bank accounts through which it receives and pays out money for various purposes. The types of accounts maintained are as under:

* **Collection Accounts** are maintained to receive investments into schemes from investors.
* **Investment Accounts** are maintained by the custodian bank, to settle securities transactions.
* **Redemption Accounts** are specifically funded to payout investors.
* **Expense Accounts** are used to meet regular fund running expenses.

The functions of collecting bankers are as follows:

* They collect payment instruments through the clearing process to realise the funds paid by the investors.
* They provide reverse feeds showing the cleared or bounced status of the instruments.
* The NFO collecting bankers accept NFO applications. After the NFO, they provide a ‘collections confirmation certificate’. The bank’s collection figures are reconciled with the RTA’s records before allotting units to investors.

## Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)

ASBA is a payment facility available to investors for all mutual fund NFOs, launched on or after October 1, 2010. The investor blocks the required sum of money in the bank account to subscribe to the NFO. The investor account gets debited only on allotment of the units. Banks specified by SEBI provide the facility. Mutual Funds/ AMCs shall make all relevant disclosures in this regard in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI).
