## **By the structure of the fund**

### Open-ended funds

**Open-ended funds** allow the investors to enter or exit at any time, after the NFO. Investors can buy additional units in the scheme any time after the scheme opens for on-going transactions. Prospective investors can also buy units. At any time, the existing investors can redeem their investments, that is, they can sell the units back to the scheme to get their money back. When an investor invests money in the scheme, new units would be created and thus the unit balance would increase. On the other hand, when someone exits the scheme (fully or partly), the units sold back to the scheme would be cancelled, due to which the unit balance of the scheme would go down.

### Closed-ended funds

**Close-ended funds** have a fixed maturity. Investors can buy units of a close-ended scheme, from the fund, only during its NFO. The investors cannot transact with the fund after the NFO is over. At the end of the maturity period, the scheme is wound up, units are cancelled and the money is returned to the investors. The fund makes arrangements for providing liquidity, post-NFO through listing of the units on a stock exchange. Such listing is compulsory for close-ended schemes to provide liquidity to the investors. Therefore, after the NFO, investors who want to buy units will have to find a seller for those units in the stock exchange. Similarly, investors who want to sell units will have to find a buyer for those units in the stock exchange. Since post-NFO sale and purchase of units happen to or from counter-party in the stock exchangeâ€“and not to or from the schemeâ€“the unit capital of the scheme remains stable or fixed.

Post-NFO, the sale and purchase transactions happen on the stock exchange between two different investors, and the fund is not involved in the transaction. Depending on the demand- supply situation for the units of the scheme on the stock exchange, the transaction price could be higher or lower than the prevailing NAV.

### Interval funds

**Interval funds** combine features of both open-ended and close-ended schemes. They are largely close-ended but become open-ended at pre-specified intervals. For instance, an interval scheme might become open-ended between January 1 to 15, and July 1 to 15, each year. The benefit for investors is that, unlike in a purely close-ended scheme, they are not completely dependent on the stock exchange to be able to buy or sell units of the interval fund. However, to provide liquidity to the investors between these intervals, the units must be compulsorily listed on stock exchanges to allow investors an exit route.

The periods when an interval scheme becomes open-ended, are called â€˜transaction periodsâ€™; the period between the close of a transaction period, and the opening of the next transaction period is called â€˜interval periodâ€™. Minimum duration of transaction period is 2 days, and maximum duration of interval period is 15 days. No redemption/repurchase of units is allowed except during the specified transaction period (during which both subscription and redemption may be made to and from the scheme).

The Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), are an innovation that addresses this liquidity issue. The market price also tracks the NAV very closely.

## **By the management of the portfolio**

### Actively Managed Funds

**Actively managed funds** are funds where the fund manager has the flexibility to choose the investment portfolio, within the broad parameters of the investment objective of the scheme. Since this increases the role of the fund manager, the expenses for running the fund turn out to be higher. Investors expect actively managed funds to perform better than the market.

### Passive Funds

**Passive funds** invest on the basis of a specified index; whose performance it seeks to track. Thus, a passive fund tracking the S\&P BSE Sensex would buy only the shares that are part of the composition of the S\&P BSE Sensex. The proportion of each share in the schemeâ€™s portfolio would also be the same as the weightage assigned to the share in the S\&P BSE Sensex. Thus, the performance of these funds tends to mirror the concerned index. They are not designed to perform better than the market.

> Such schemes are also called index schemes.

Since the portfolio is determined by the index itself, the fund manager has no role in deciding on investments. Therefore, these schemes have low running costs.

## **By the investment universe**

This type of classification looks at the investment universe where the scheme may invest money. There are equity funds, fixed income funds, money market funds, gold funds, international funds, etc. Here, the category names indicate where the money could be invested.

This classification may get further specific depending on narrowing the investment universe. For example, within equity funds, we have large-cap funds, mid-cap funds, etc. Similarly, within debt funds, we have Government Securities funds, and corporate debt funds.

## **Mutual fund scheme categorization and SEBI regulation**

With a view to bring-in standardization in classification of mutual funds and to ensure the schemes are clearly distinct from one another, SEBI issued a circular on Categorization and Rationalization of Mutual Fund Schemes in 2017.

The objective was to bring uniformity in the characteristics of similar type of schemes launched by different mutual fund houses so that the investor can objectively evaluate the schemes chosen for investment. Accordingly, there are five broad categories of mutual fund schemes. Within each category, there are many sub-categories.

1. Equity Schemes (10 sub-categories)
2. Debt Schemes (16 sub-categories)
3. Hybrid Schemes (6 sub-categories)
4. Solution Oriented Schemes (2 sub-categories)
5. Other Schemes (2 sub-categories)

## Others

Apart from the above, let us also take a look at certain other categories:

#### Fixed Maturity Plans

**Fixed Maturity Plans** are a kind of close-ended debt fund where the duration of the investment portfolio is closely aligned to the maturity of the scheme. AMCs tend to structure the scheme around pre-identified investments. Further, being close-ended schemes, they do not accept money post-NFO. Therefore, the fund manager has little ongoing role in deciding on the investment options. Such a portfolio construction gives more clarity to investors on the likely returns if they stay invested in the scheme until its maturity (though there can be no guarantee or assurance of such returns). This helps them compare the risk and returns of the scheme with alternative investments.

#### Capital Protection Funds

**Capital Protection Funds** are closed-end hybrids funds. In these types of funds, the exposure to equity is typically taken through the equity derivatives market. The portfolio is structured such that a portion of the principal amount is invested in debt instruments so that it grows to the principal amount over the term of the fund. For example, Rs.90 may be invested for 3 years to grow into Rs.100 at maturity. This provides the protection to the capital invested. The remaining portion of the original amount is invested in equity derivatives to earn higher returns.

#### Infrastructure Debt Funds

**Infrastructure Debt Funds** are investment vehicles which can be sponsored by commercial banks and NBFCs in India in which domestic/offshore institutional investors, specially insurance and pension funds can invest through units and bonds issued by the IDFs. Infrastructure Debt Funds (IDFs), can be set up either as a Trust or as a Company. A trust based IDF would normally be a Mutual Fund (MF), regulated by SEBI, while a company based IDF would normally be a NBFC regulated by the Reserve Bank.

According to SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations, IDF means a close ended mutual fund scheme that invests primarily (minimum 90 percent of scheme assets) in the debt securities or securitized debt instrument of infrastructure companies or infrastructure capital companies or infrastructure projects or special purpose vehicles which are created for the purpose of facilitating or promoting investment in infrastructure, and other permissible assets in accordance with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 or bank loans in respect of completed and revenue generating projects of infrastructure companies or projects or special purpose vehicles. IDF-MFs can be sponsored by banks and NBFCs. Only banks and Infrastructure Finance companies can sponsor IDF-NBFCs.

#### Real Estate Mutual Fund

**Real Estate Mutual Fund** scheme invests directly or indirectly in real estate assets or other permissible assets in accordance with the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. SEBIâ€™s regulations require that at least 35 percent of the portfolio should be held in physical assets. Not less than 75 percent of the net assets of the scheme shall be in real estate assets, mortgage- backed securities (but not directly in mortgages), equity shares or debentures of companies engaged in dealing in real estate assets or in undertaking real estate development projects. Assets held by the fund will be valued every 90 days by two valuers accredited by a credit rating agency. The lower of the two values will be taken to calculate the NAV. These funds are closed- end funds and have to be listed on a stock exchange. Other real estate and infrastructure investment instruments allowed by SEBI are Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). However, these two are not mutual fund schemes.

## REIT & INVIT

#### REIT

**Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT)** are trusts registered with SEBI that invest in commercial real estate assets. The REIT will raise funds through an initial offer and subsequently through follow-on offers, rights issue and institutional placements. The value of the assets owned or proposed to be owned by a REIT coming out with an initial offer will not be less than Rs. 500 crore and the minimum offer size will not be less than Rs.250 crore. The minimum subscription amount in an initial offer shall be Rs. 50,000/. The units are listed on the stock exchange.

#### INVIT

**Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvIT)** are trusts registered with SEBI that invest in the infrastructure sector. The InvIT will raise funds from the public through an initial offer of units. The offer shall be for not less than Rs. 250 crores and the value of the proposed assets of the InvIT shall not be less than Rs. 500 crores. The minimum subscription size will be Rs.1 lakh. The units are listed on a stock exchange.
