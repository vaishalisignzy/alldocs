# MF Terminology

## Unitholder

When investors subscribe to a mutual fund, they buy a share in the pool of funds. This share is called a unit of the mutual fund scheme.

> The investment in a mutual fund is represented to the investor in units.

A mutual fund investor is called a unitholder just as an investor in equity shares is called a shareholder. The ownership of the fund is jointly held by all the unitholders. Just as investors in equity hold shares of a company, mutual fund investors hold units of the fund. Each unit has a face value. This is typically Rs 10 per unit for most mutual funds.

## New Fund Offer (NFO)

Equity shares are offered to investors for the first time through an initial public offering (IPO). Subsequently equity shares are bought and sold on the stock exchange.

Likewise, mutual funds are offered for the first time to investors through a new fund offer (NFO). Open-ended mutual fund units can be bought and sold through the fund itself. Closed-ended mutual funds are listed and can be bought and sold on the stock exchange. The mutual fund units are offered to the public for the first time through new fund offer (NFO). A mutual fund product begins its life on the NFO start date. Investors can start investing in the fund from this date. The NFO close date is defined in the offer document. During the NFO period (open date to close date) the units are purchased at the NFO price. The NFO for mutual funds (except ELSS) shall be open for a period not more than 15 days.

Certain types of funds called Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) can only be bought and sold through the stock exchanges.

## Inception Date

The fund begins to declare its NAV from the next day of allotment. The date of allotment is the inception date of the fund, when its NAV is set at face value. Transactions in the fund can begin from the next day when the first NAV of the fund will be declared. Schemes are required by regulation to open for transactions within 5 working days of allotment.

## Assets Under Management (AUM)

A portfolio is a collection of securities. These securities can be equity shares, bonds, debentures, deposits, money market instruments, derivatives and the like. Mutual funds can invest only in marketable securities, or securities that can be traded in a market and therefore have a market price.

The value of the fund’s portfolio changes with changes in market value of the securities that have been bought. The portfolio is updated every day, to represent its current market value. This process is called ‘marking to market’.

> The market value of the portfolio is known as the assets under management (AUM) of the fund.

The value of the portfolio changes every time there is a change in market price of the securities that a mutual fund holds.

The sum of all investments made by investors’ in the mutual fund scheme is the entire mutual fund scheme’s size, which is also known as the scheme’s Assets Under Management (AUM). This can also be obtained by multiplying the current NAV with the total units outstanding. The relative size of mutual fund companies/asset management companies is assessed by their assets under management (AUM). When a scheme is first launched, assets under management is the amount mobilized from investors. Thereafter, if the scheme has a positive profitability metric, its AUM goes up; a negative profitability metric will pull it down.

Further, if the scheme is open to receiving money from investors even post-NFO, then such contributions from investors boost the AUM. Conversely, if the scheme pays any money to the investors, either as dividend or as consideration for buying back the units of investors, the AUM falls.

## Total Expense Ratio

The activities associated with portfolio management involve costs and fees. These expenses are charged to the mutual fund scheme. Regulations cover what kind of costs can be charged to the scheme and also prescribe limits on these expenses. These expenses are represented as a percentage of AUM and are called Total Expense ratio (TER). These expenses are charged to the AUM of the scheme on a daily accrual basis.

> TER, for instance, if calculated at 2 percent of the AUM, is divided by 365 to get the daily accrual. The value of the portfolio is re-calculated daily and represented as market value (AUM). The expenses (TER) are accrued every day and charged to AUM.

## Net Assets

Net assets refer to the net value of the portfolio, after charging the expenses. When we divide the net assets of a fund by the number of outstanding units issued, we get the net asset value (NAV) per unit. Net assets of a mutual fund may change with the change in the market value of the portfolio or change in the expenses charged to the fund.

Mutual funds declare the NAV of all their schemes on every business day. The NAV of all mutual fund schemes have to be uploaded on AMFI’s website and also on the Mutual Funds’ website by the time as per applicable guidelines. All mutual fund schemes (except for fund of fund schemes) shall update their latest NAVs by 9 p.m. of the same day and Fund of Fund schemes shall update the latest NAVs by 10 a.m. the following business day.

## Assets & Liabilities in a Mutual Fund Portfolio

When we refer to total assets, we are referring to the market value of the mutual fund portfolio. A mutual fund rarely holds any other long-term asset in its balance sheet. There may be few receivables and accrued income, which are current assets. These are added to the portfolio value to get the total assets of the fund. Similarly on the liability side, a mutual fund does not have long-term liabilities.

The expenses associated with managing the portfolio are accrued as current liabilities and are paid as they become due. Therefore net assets of a fund refer to the market value of the portfolio, plus accrued incomes, less any current liabilities and accrued expenses. Net asset value (NAV) is a per unit representation of the net assets of a fund. NAV is a very frequently used term in the mutual fund industry. It refers to the current value per unit, deriving out of the current value of the mutual fund portfolio.

## **Units**

The investment that an investor makes in a scheme is translated into a certain number of ‘Units’ in the scheme. Thus, an investor in a scheme is issued units of the scheme.

## **Face Value**

Typically, every unit has a face value of Rs. 10. The face value is relevant from an accounting perspective.

## **Unit Capital**

The number of units issued by a scheme multiplied by its face value (Rs. 10) is the capital of the scheme, its Unit Capital.

## **Recurring Expenses**

The fees or commissions paid to various mutual fund constituents come out of the expenses charged to the mutual fund scheme. These are known as recurring expenses. These expenses are charged as a percentage to the scheme’s assets under management (AUM). The scheme expenses are deducted while calculating the NAV. This means that higher the expenses, lower the NAV, and hence lower the investor returns. Given this, SEBI has imposed strict limits on how much expenses could be charged to the scheme. For running the scheme of mutual funds, operating expenses are also incurred.

## **Net Asset Value (NAV)**

The true worth of a unit of the mutual fund scheme is otherwise called Net Asset Value (NAV) of the scheme. When the investment activity is profitable, the true worth of a unit increases. When there are losses, the true worth of a unit decreases. The NAV is also the net realizable value per unit in case the scheme is to be liquidated, how much money could be generated if all the holdings of the scheme are sold and converted into cash.

## **Mark To Market**

The process of valuing each security in the investment portfolio of the scheme at its current market value is called Mark to Market (MTM). The mark-to-market valuation is done on a daily basis for calculation of daily NAV of a mutual fund scheme. This results in daily fluctuations in the NAVs of all schemes.
