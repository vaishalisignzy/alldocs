## Introduction

The term 'scheme' or 'plan' usually indicates the various products a mutual fund. The term 'fund' is also used to refer to a mutual fund product. When we say mutual fund, we are not referring to a particular product. For example, HDFC mutual fund is not a single product, but represents all the schemes and products under that umbrella. HDFC Liquid Fund, on the other hand, refers to a specific product of HDFC mutual fund, which is a debt scheme, investing in debt and money market securities.

The mutual fund is an umbrella entity, and there are several funds/schemes/plans with distinct objectives underneath this entity. Investors invest in a specific fund/scheme/plan. The products offered by a mutual fund are known as schemes, or funds.

## Direct & Regular Plans

Mutual funds offer investors two plans or routes to invest in a mutual fund. They are:

1. Direct Plan
2. Regular Plan

### Direct Plan

The direct plan is for investors who wish to invest directly in the mutual fund without routing the investment through a distributor. The direct plan will have a lower expense ratio since it eliminates the distribution expenses or commissions. The plan will have a separate NAV that will reflect the lower expenses under this plan.

### Regular Plan

Under the regular plan the investor indicates a distributor through whose services the investment decision was made and executed. The AMFI Registration Number (ARN) is made available by the investor in the application form and the mutual fund pays the transaction charges and commissions to the distributor so identified. The expenses under the Regular plan are higher because of the distribution commissions involved.

üí° The only difference between the two plans is the fee structure. The direct plan of a mutual fund holds exactly the same assets as the regular plan but includes no expenses for distributor commissions.

## **Dividend Pay-Out, Dividend Re-Investment and Growth Options**

Most mutual fund schemes offer two options ‚Äì Dividend and Growth. A third option, which is possible, is the dividend re-investment option. These are different options within a scheme having the same portfolio. Therefore, the portfolio returns are the same for all three options. However, they differ in the structure of cash flows and income accruals for the unitholder, and therefore there is a difference in the unitholder‚Äôs taxability, number of units held and value of those units. The post-tax return from each of these options will therefore be different.

### Dividend Pay-Out Plan

In a **dividend pay-out option**, the fund declares a dividend from time to time. Some schemes (liquid and debt funds with very short term maturity) even declare a dividend daily, subject to availability of profits. When a dividend is paid, the NAV of the units falls to that extent. The reduced NAV, after a dividend pay-out is called ex-Dividend NAV. After a dividend is announced, and until it is paid out, it is referred to as cum-Dividend NAV.

### Dividend Re-Investment Plan

In a **dividend re-investment option**, as in the case of dividend pay-out option, NAV declines to the extent of dividend. The resulting NAV is called ex-dividend NAV, like in case of dividend pay- out plan.

However, the investor does not receive the dividend in his bank account; the amount is re- invested in the same scheme and additional units are allotted to the investor. The reinvestment happens at the ex-dividend NAV. Thus, if dividend is Rs 2 per unit on a unitholder‚Äôs 100 units, the dividend would amount to Rs 200. Assuming the ex-dividend NAV of the scheme is Rs 20, then Rs 200 √∑ Rs 20 i.e. 10 units will be added to the unit-holder‚Äôs portfolio.

### Growth Plan

In a **growth option**, dividend is not declared. Therefore, nothing is received in the bank account (unlike dividend pay-out option) and there is nothing to re-invest (unlike dividend re-investment option). The NAV would therefore capture the full value of the portfolio gains. As in the case of dividend pay-out option, there will be no accretion to the number of units held. The NAV of those units will however be higher, to reflect the gain in the portfolio.

## Product Creation Process

The AMC describes the portfolio. This description is then given a product name. An offer document is created with the product details. The draft offer document is approved by the trustees and filed with SEBI for their comments/ observations. Post the incorporation of all the comments and suggestions by SEBI (if any), AMC shall issue the final offer document. The product is open for subscription to investors as a New Fund Offer (NFO). Investors are allotted units against their investment at the face value of the units. After the money is collected, fund managers begin to construct the portfolio.

### Offer Document, Addendum & KIM

SEBI requires that AMCs provide relevant and complete information to help the investor take an informed decision to invest in mutual funds. All such information is provided in the offer document of the scheme.

The Offer Document (OD) has to be in the format prescribed by SEBI. Mutual Fund Offer Document consists of two parts:

1. Statement of Additional Information (SAI) which has statutory information about the mutual fund or AMC offering the scheme.
2. Scheme Information Document (SID) which has details of the particular scheme.

‚ÄúMutual fund investments are subject to market risk. Please read all scheme related documents before investing.‚Äù These lines are mentioned in all mutual fund related communications. So, what are the scheme related documents?

The legal documents that provide the information that the investor requires is available in the scheme related documents (Scheme Information Document, Statement of Additional Information) and the Key Information Memorandum.

There are primarily two important documents for understanding about the mutual fund scheme:

1. **Scheme Information Document (SID),** which has details of the particular scheme
2. **Statement of Additional Information (SAI),** which has statutory information about the mutual fund or AMC, that is offering the scheme.

It stands to reason that a single SAI is relevant for all the schemes offered by a mutual fund. In practice, SID and SAI are two separate documents, though the legal technicality is that SAI is part of the SID.

Both documents are prepared in the format prescribed by SEBI and submitted to SEBI. The contents need to flow in the same sequence as in the prescribed format. The mutual fund is permitted to add any other disclosure, which it feels, is ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô for the investor.

While SEBI does not approve or disapprove the Scheme Related Documents, it gives its observations. The mutual fund needs to incorporate these observations in these documents. Thus, the Documents in the market are ‚Äúvetted‚Äù by SEBI, and not approved by SEBI.

Draft SID and SAI are public documents, available for viewing on SEBI‚Äôs website. The final documents (after incorporating SEBI‚Äôs observations) have to be hosted on AMFI‚Äôs website two days before the issue opens. Every mutual fund, on its website, provides for download of these documents for all its current schemes.

#### Statement Of Additional Information (SAI)

The SAI contains information common to all schemes offered by a mutual fund. It is filed with SEBI as a one-time filing.

The information includes:

* Details of the Sponsor, trustee, AMC and other constituents
* Condensed financial information of all the schemes launched in last 3 financial years
* Rights of unit holders, investor grievance redressal
* Investment valuation norms
* Other common information

The SAI has to be updated every financial year. Any material changes have to be incorporated immediately and uploaded on the mutual fund and AMFI websites.

#### Scheme Information Document (SID)

Information about the mutual fund scheme is provided in the Scheme Information Document (SID). This includes:

* Name and type of scheme
* Fees and expenses of the scheme
* Performance, in case of an existing scheme
* Mandatory disclosures and disclaimers
* Closed-end debt funds have to provide the additional information on portfolio such as the policy for evaluating the credit risk in the security and sectors in which the fund will invest.

The SID has to be updated every financial year even if there is no change in the material factors. If there is a change in the fundamental attributes, the SID has to be updated immediately after the lapse of the time period given to existing investors to exit the scheme. For other changes, the AMC issues an addendum which is attached to the existing SID.

Every Addendum has to be approved by trustees. The information in the addendum is included in the SAI or SID as the case may be, when they are revised every year. Until then, all the issued addenda have to be attached to the older version of the SAI/SID.

#### Key Information Memorandum (KIM)

Key information memorandum (KIM) is a synopsis of important information contained in the SID and SAI. It also contains information that is useful for filling up the application form. The application form is accompanied by the KIM. According to regulation, both application form and KIM have to be printed together and made available to the investor. The format for KIM is prescribed by SEBI.

### Riskometer

The ‚ÄòRiskometer‚Äô categorizes risk in one of the following five levels:

* **Low** - principal at low risk
* **Moderately Low** - principal at moderately low risk
* **Moderate** - principal at moderate risk
* **Moderately High** - principal at moderately high risk
* **High** - principal at high risk
