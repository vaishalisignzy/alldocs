## Application Form

The application form provides required information about an investor of a mutual fund. The information captured in the application form is entered in the RTA records. The investor is then assigned a folio number by the AMC. A folio is like a bank account number, created for a fund house and its investors. Investors can hold units under multiple schemes of a fund house, in a folio.

In order to verify subsequent transactions from the investor, the investorâ€™s signature is scanned and maintained in the RTA system with the investor records. For subsequent purchase transactions, if the folio number is quoted, several fields in an application form need not be filled up again.

The following are mandatory fields:

* Investor status in terms of resident/non-resident
* Details of bank account
* Complete address of first holder
* Date of birth and guardian details for minors
* PAN details
* Signature of applicants

## Transaction Slip

The application form is designed to capture all investor information for the first time. Investors can use a transaction slip for subsequent transactions. A transaction slip has the folio number to identify the investor in the system.

## Purchase Transactions

Mutual fund units can be purchased during NFO or after the scheme opens for on-going offer (if open-ended) after allotment of NFO units.

ðŸ’¡ When a new investor applies for units either during NFO or during continuous offer, it is called fresh purchase.

Fresh purchases are made by investors by submitting an application form complete in all respects.

ðŸ’¡ After the fresh purchase, every subsequent purchase by the unit holder is called additional purchase.

Additional units can be purchased by using a transaction slip. An existing investor may decide to make additional purchases under a new folio. This will be considered as fresh purchase.

Mutual funds incur expenses such as advertisement costs, commission to distributors, and printing costs towards selling and marketing a scheme. To meet these expenses, funds charge entry load or sales load.

Entry load is a percentage of the NAV of the unit. In an NFO, load is charged as percentage of the face value. Entry load increases the price at which an investor buys units. Hence, for the same amount invested, units allotted to investors paying a load are lesser, as compared to units allotted without load.

It may be noted that SEBI has abolished entry load.

## Statement of Account (SoA) and Consolidated Account Statement (CAS)

Statement of Account (SoA) is a proof of investment for the investor. A SoA is sent when an investor makes a fresh purchase transaction. The amount, price, and units are shown. For subsequent transactions, apart from these details, the balance units in the folio and their current market value are also shown in the SoA. RTA agents, on behalf of mutual funds, despatch SoAs to investors, whenever there is a transaction in a folio.

As per SEBI regulations, the dispatch date should not be later than 5 business days from the date of the transaction. In case of NFOs, the SoA has to be sent within 5 business days of closure of NFO. Statement of Account (SoA) is issued every month if there is a transaction during the month. If there are no transactions in a folio in a six month period, a SoA will be sent giving the latest closing balance.

A Consolidated Account Statement (CAS) has to be sent for each calendar month by post or email before the 10th of the succeeding month. If the email is registered with the fund then the CAS will be sent only by email. Investors will be identified across mutual funds by the PAN for the purpose of CAS. If there are no transactions in a folio during a six month period, the CAS will be sent at the end of each such six month period (September/ March). Unit holders receive account statement through their registered email address. The unit holder may request for a physical account statement by writing/calling the AMC/RTA.

## Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)

Most mutual funds offer the investors Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), a facility to make periodic or recurring purchases in mutual fund schemes. SIP is like a recurring deposit with a mutual fund. SIP can be viewed as a series of purchase transactions. The difference between SIP and a regular purchase transaction are as follows:

### Payment Instruments for SIPs

**Post dated cheques (PDCs):** Investor issues cheques for each SIP instalment, which have to be deposited in the bank on that date.

**NACH Mandate:** In place of ECS, NACH mandate is introduced either for periodical payment or as and when demanded, investors fill up the NACH mandate form and submit it with their application. They can mention this as a One Time Mandate (OTM) and use for one time /periodical/as and when investments.

**Standing Instruction (SI):** If the investor holds an account in the same bank as the scheme, he can give a standing instruction to his bank to transfer the money on the SIP date.

Mandates for direct debit of bank accounts require signatures of holders of the bank account, according to the mode of operation of the account (joint or either or survivor).

## Redemption

After the NFO, when a scheme re-opens, the continuous offer is for both purchase and redemption of units. Redemption refers to investors' request to return their investments in a fund.

In case of open-ended funds, on redemption the units are extinguished or cancelled and are not re-issued. Redemption alters the unit capital of an open ended scheme. Therefore outstanding unit capital is communicated by the RTA, after processing all purchase and redemption transactions for every business day.

In case of closed end funds, redemption of units happens only on the maturity date of the scheme. Redemption may be allowed during specified periods before maturity date or at a cost as specified in the offer document.

Investors can specify the redemption of units held in a folio either in terms of number of units or as amount in rupees. Where redemption is specified in amount, the investor must ensure that the value of their holding is sufficient to meet the amount.

Investors can redeem all or part of the units in a folio; or they can redeem all or part of the amount in the folio. The redemption request has to be equal to or more than the minimum amount or units specified in the offer document. Mutual funds may specify the minimum balance to be maintained in a folio after redemption.

## Exit Load

Exit load has the effect of reducing the redemption price for the investor. If the investor has specified the redemption in unit terms, the redemption value comes down because of the load. For example, at an NAV of Rs. 20 per unit, redeeming 1000 units will get the investor Rs. 20,000. However, if the exit load is 1%, the redemption price is 20 - 0.20 = Rs. 19.80. Therefore the redemption proceeds are Rs. 19,800 for 1000 units.

## Switch

A switch is a redemption and purchase transaction rolled into one. A redeeming scheme is called source scheme from which money is switched out. The purchasing scheme is called target scheme, into which the money is switched in. Switch can also be done from one option to another. An investor who has chosen a growth option can switch to a dividend option, for example.

The following are steps an investor would have to normally take to move from one scheme to the other:

* Fill a redemption request and submit it (Day T)
* Receive redemption cheque and deposit it in bank (Day T+3/T+4)
* Receive cleared funds in bank account (Day T+5)
* Fill a purchase request for the desired scheme and submit with a cheque (Day T+5)

The above steps spread across five days can be crunched into a single transaction in switch request. The transaction will be put through by the R\&T agent in the books and the funds will be credited to the schemeâ€™s account.

AMCs may or may not charge loads to switch transactions. Generally, no exit load is charged for switching within options of the same scheme. For inter-scheme switching, the AMC may specify an independent load structure, which may differ based on the nature of the source scheme and the target scheme, whether it is liquid, equity, or debt fund.

Switch transactions always have two legs â€“ the switch-out leg and the switch-in leg. Switch- out leg is treated as redemption and switch-in leg is treated as purchase. Both options are processed at the respective applicable NAV of the scheme.

## Systematic Withdrawal and Transfer Plans

Mutual funds also offer investors systematic transfer plans and systematic withdrawal plans.

**Systematic Transfer Plan (STP)** is a facility for periodic redemption from one scheme and investment into another scheme of the same fund. STP allows unit holders to transfer fixed sums from an existing scheme to another scheme of the same mutual fund.

**Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)** is a facility for periodic or recurring redemptions. This facility allows unit holders to withdraw sums from an existing scheme at periodic intervals.

ðŸ’¡ Unit holders can redeem or purchase units at the applicable NAV on the respective SWP/ STP dates. However, if any of the dates on which the redemption / transfer is sought is a non-business day, the units are redeemed at the applicable NAV of the next business day.

An account statement is sent to a unit holder within 10 working days from the date of the transaction. The first account statement confirms the first systematic transaction. The account statement confirming subsequent systematic transactions is sent on a quarterly basis.

ðŸ’¡ Some funds give investors the choice of withdrawing or transferring a fixed sum over a defined period. This is known as the fixed option. Under this option, a unit holder withdraws or switches a fixed amount of not less than the minimum from his unit account.
