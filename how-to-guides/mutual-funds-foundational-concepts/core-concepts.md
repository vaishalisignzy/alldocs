## What is a "Mutual Fund"?

Investors buy equity shares, debentures, jewellery and gold coins, residential and commercial property with their savings. This is the direct way of investing where assets bought are held directly in their names.

A mutual fund is an investment option, where investors contribute small amounts of money. These contributions are pooled together to make it a large sum. This sum is then invested in a portfolio of various securities.

When we say 'Mutual Fund' we are referring to the money contributed by the investors. When we say 'portfolio' we are referring to the securities in which the investments have been made.

A mutual fund thus enables investors to participate in securities markets and invest in equity shares, bonds and other such instruments by pooling their money together. A mutual fund will state its objective up front. This indicates how the money will be invested and how the portfolio will be constructed. Investors choose a fund, which matches their own objectives.

A mutual fund is a collective investment vehicle. Usually a mutual fund product is first described by its investment objective. Investors then invest their money in the product. The money is pooled together and is invested according to the stated objective.

ðŸ’¡ A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment vehicle.

Practically, one does not invest in mutual fund, but invests through mutual funds. Thus, an investor does not get a different product, but gets a different way of investing. The difference lies in the professional way of investing, portfolio diversification, and a regulated vehicle.

ðŸ’¡ The primary role of mutual funds is to help investors in earning an income or building their wealth, by investing in the opportunities available in securities markets. It is possible for mutual funds to structure a scheme for different kinds of investment objectives.

## Assets Classes

### What is an Asset Class?

An asset class is a grouping of investments that have similar characteristics.

There are four broad asset categories or asset classes, and then there are various subcategories, within each of these. The four broad categoriesâ€” Real estate, Commodities, Equity and Fixed income.

Out of these, real estate and commodities are also called real assets, whereas equity and debt are called financial assets. The real assets are available in physical form, whereas the other two would only be available in financial form.

## Role of MF

As discussed earlier, investors need to invest our money from time to time. These investments can be made in various financial instruments ranging from Government sponsored schemes to bank fixed deposits to company debentures to shares of companies or real estate properties of even precious metals like gold or silver.

One option is to manage the investments oneself. That would involve finding the right investments and carrying out the related research and administration work. The other option is to outsource the entire job to a professional or a company engaged in such a business.

Mutual fund is that second option â€“ it is managed by a team of professionals, known as the asset management company. This is what really needs to be understood. By choosing to invest through mutual funds, one is not investing in alternative investment options, but only changing the way of investing money. The entire job of investing is outsourced to a professional firm.

What is missed out in this comparison is the hidden costs of doing the investment management job on oneâ€™s own. This hidden cost comes in the form of oneâ€™s time and the potential mistakes that an individual investor is likely to make.

For most investors, mutual fund would turn out to be a better option than to build the portfolio oneself.
