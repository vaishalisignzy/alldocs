# New Releases

### Added - 17 Dec, 2020&#x20;

* We have recently released search space functionality in Deep face Auth which can help customers optimize search by creating a set of faces that are present in a location and eventually identifying the user who is doing a face auth in that particular location in those set of faces. We call the whole activity a SEARCH SPACE.\
  \
  Go check the "User" section under "USER MANAGEMENT" to explore search space.
