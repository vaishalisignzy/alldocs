## Creating Document Forms

Here, we will be simply choosing the template type for each documents created.

Generic Onboarding provides **3 types of templates** for documents:&#x20;

### 1. Extraction screen template:&#x20;

This template type helps extract data from the document uploaded by the onboarding merchant by using OCR, and the extracted data is automatically filled in the application form.
