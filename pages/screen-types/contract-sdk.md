# Contract SDK

The Contract SDK is almost similar to what we saw in the Contract, but the difference lies in the ability to sign the contract.

What happens if we select the Contract screen type is, the onboarding merchant while going through the onboarding process needs to sign in the contract then and there, then only the journey gets completed.

But in Contract SDK merchants can fill out all the details, submit the supporting documents, complete the onboarding journey but can sign the contract later on through their email within a valid time.
