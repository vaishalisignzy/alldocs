You have a username and an API key. The key also acts like your password to the APIs. You need to have an access token for making any further API calls, which you can receive by logging in manually or programmatically using these credentials.

Signzy APIs adhere to authentication defined by Swagger 2.0 specifications. Each call to the APIs should include an 'Authorization' header or 'access\_token' query parameter for authentication.
