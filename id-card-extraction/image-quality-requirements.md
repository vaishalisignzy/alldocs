### Good Lighting

Good lighting helps to achieve better OCR results. If the image is too dark or too bright, the document might not be processed successfully

### Avoid Reflections

Glares and reflections interfere with processing and reduce data extraction accuracy. We recommend not to use the flash of your mobile device when capturing document images.

### Focus and Sharpness

Make sure the image is clear and there are no blurred areas.

### Angle

The tilt angle of the document should not exceed 10 degrees in any direction (horizontal or vertical).

### Margins (too small)

Make sure there is minimal space around the document. It is recommended that the document takes up 70-80% of the image.

### Margins (too big)

Make sure the space around the document does not take up more than 20-30% of the image. It is recommended that the document takes up 70-80% of the image.

### Contrast

The document should be in clear contrast to the background. A light-colored document on a light background, as well as a dark-colored document on a dark background, might not be recognized.

### Resolution of the image

To achieve a good quality of recognition of identification documents, we recommend that you provide images captured by a camera with a resolution of at least Full HD (1920x1080) and autofocus.

### Extraneous objects

Make sure your hands or other objects do not cover document data.
