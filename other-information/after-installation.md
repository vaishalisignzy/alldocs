# After installation

Once installation is completed, you might want to test the application once before releasing to your users or business team for testing or to infosec team for doing VAPT

### Sanity testing <a href="#h.tpdp11i1zwqk" id="h.tpdp11i1zwqk"></a>

Signzy recommends conducting one round of sanity testing end to end to ensure that all the features are running smoothly. This is applicable in both the UAT and production environments.

#### Vulnerability assessment <a href="#h.w9le43oxo92e" id="h.w9le43oxo92e"></a>

Once the installations are completed, you may decide to provide the required information to your information security team.

1. Hostname, IPs and the deployment topology for Vulnerability Assessment (VA)
2. Application URLs and credentials for different roles like maker, checker and Ops users for penetration testing.

Even though Signzy ensures to keep the operating system images up to date with latest security configurations both at the OS level and the application level, clients & their information security team may require additional changes to be done. If you require any further setup or changes in terms of security configurations or setup, kindly connect with your Signzy POC to be taken up as a change request (CR).
