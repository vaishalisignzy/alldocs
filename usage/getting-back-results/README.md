# Getting Back Results

#### Sending requests <a href="#sending-requests" id="sending-requests"></a>

For sending request the hostname and protocol will be same as given in [Authentication](../../authorizing-your-access.md) section.

You can do this in two ways. One, by using "[Pull Data By Id](pull-data-by-id.md)" API, you can fetch each merchant's onboarding results using merchantid. The second API "[Pull All Data](pull-all-data.md)" allows you to pull entire result of the merchants who have been onboarded.
