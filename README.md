# Multi tenant architecture

### Philosophy behind having multi-tenant architecture

The main idea of this system is to have a central maintainable system that can generate workflows for our on-boarding products.&#x20;

For a new product which has a new workflow and/or customisation on the components of individual sections in the product.&#x20;
