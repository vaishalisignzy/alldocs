### What is onboarding <a href="#_2dplqif1c91r" id="_2dplqif1c91r"></a>

In financial and non-financial institutions, onboarding refers to the process of getting a new client on board.

The onboarding process of any new client involves gathering information on the customer and conducting identity checks to comply with KYC regulations.

### Traditional Onboarding Process <a href="#_tofgfybp5ntw" id="_tofgfybp5ntw"></a>

Traditionally, the onboarding process in financial institutions involves multiple forms, paper files, manual compliance checks and in-person identification checks.

However, this process was time-consuming and had a poor user experience. Meeting compliance and legal regulation is often the most time-consuming stage because of the vast number of documents and volume of data that needs to be collected and analysed.
