# ID Card Extraction SDK

Signzy ID Card Extraction SDK offers extraction of fields for various id cards even when the device is offline. The advantage of using this SDK is that the merchant app doesn't need to specify the type of Id card being scanned for extraction. The SDK automatically detects the type of card and extracts the data.

This SDK provides two functionalities -

1. Classification of ID cards.

&#x20;   2\. Extraction of ID cards.

&#x20;   3\. Works both online and offline seamlessly

&#x20;   4\. Fully Customizable to suit your Ui/UX need

&#x20;   5\. Provides complete native mobile experience

#### Currently supported ID cards&#x20;

* Aadhar Card
* Indian Driving License
* Indian Passport
* PAN
* Business PAN
* Voter ID (currently under development)
